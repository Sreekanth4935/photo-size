## Phase 1: Foundation

### [COMPLETED] Day 1: Project Setup (2026-05-01)

- **Project created** at C:\dev\photo-size\
- **Tech stack**: Kotlin 2.1.0, AGP 8.11.2, Gradle 9.0-m1, Jetpack Compose (BOM 2024.12.01)
- **Package**: com.sreekanth.photosize
- **Architecture**: MVVM-ready package structure (ui/, viewmodel/)
- **Theme**: Material 3 with primary color #2E7D32
- **Home screen**: Centered app title, icon placeholder, Start/Settings/Info buttons
- **Dev-docs**: Full documentation folder created (8 files)

### [COMPLETED] Day 1: Device Verification (2026-05-01)

- **Build**: assembleDebug passed (BUILD SUCCESSFUL)
- **Install**: installDebug passed on Vivo V2426 (Android 16)
- **Launch**: App launched successfully, no crash
- **UI**: Home screen rendered correctly with title, buttons, edge-to-edge

### [COMPLETED] Day 1: Launcher Icon (2026-05-01)

- **Icon upgraded**: Replaced placeholder solid-color icon with themed vector drawable
- **Foreground**: Custom vector drawable in app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml
- **Background**: Solid theme color (#2E7D32)
- **Adaptive icon**: mipmap-anydpi-v26 with foreground + background + monochrome
- **Round icon**: Supported via ic_launcher_round.xml

### [COMPLETED] Day 2: Execution Plan and QA Contract Upgrade (2026-05-02)

- **Execution plan upgraded**: Added agent execution contract, quality bar, and daily definition of done
- **QA workflow added**: Created `dev-docs/test_cases.md` with automated/manual test tracking
- **Manual testing queue**: User device checks are now tracked separately from automated agent checks
- **Antigravity handoff**: Docs now require test cases to be written before each day of coding and updated after automated verification
- **Ad plan corrected**: Banner, interstitial, and Native Advanced video ads are now explicitly planned with test-only demo units until release approval
